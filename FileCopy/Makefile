# Makefile for COMP 117 End-to-End assignment
#
#    Copyright 2012 - Noah Mendelsohn
#
# The targets below are for samples that may be helpful, but:
#
#   YOUR MAIN JOB IN THIS ASSIGNMENT IS TO CREATE TWO 
#   NEW PROGRAMS: fileclient and fileserver
#
#   YOU WILL MODIFY THIS MAKEFILE TO BUILD THEM TOO
#
# Useful sample program targets:
#
#
#    nastyfiletest - demonstrates the c150nastyfile class that you 
#                    MUST use to read and write your files
#
#    sha1test -   sample code for computing SHA1 hash
#
#    makedatafile -  sometimes when testing file copy programs
#                    it's useful to have files in which it's
#                    relatively easy to spot changes.
#                    This program generates sample data files.
#
#  Maintenance targets:
#
#    Make sure these clean up and build your code too
#
#    clean       - clean out all compiled object and executable files
#    all         - (default target) make sure everything's compiled
#
